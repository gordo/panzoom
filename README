Ken Burns Effect with CSS3 (with WebKit keyframes for animation). Gecko, Presto, and Trident effectively have no equivalents, so it will not work in those browsers. This is a proof of concept.

Javascript is used to change images with alternating animations.

CSS3 animations are a part of the W3C spec, but are still in working draft at the time of this project. Much of the CSS is the same, sans the vendor prefix. http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-animations
